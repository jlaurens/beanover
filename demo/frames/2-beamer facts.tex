Beamer uses overlay specification aware commands to associate material to slides. The command%
\begin{myCodeBox}{l}%
\backslash only<2-4>\{TEXT\}
\end{myCodeBox}%
%
will display ``TEXT'' on slides 2, 3, and 4 only.

Using explicit slide numbers is sometimes difficult, incremental specifications like%
\begin{myCodeBox}{l}%
\backslash item<+>\{TEXT\}\\
\backslash item<+(-1)-+>\{TEXT\}%
\end{myCodeBox}%
may help in linear situations, but this does not fit to next simple example,
to which suit \textbf{named overlay specifications}.
